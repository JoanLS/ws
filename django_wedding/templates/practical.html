          <h2>Access to the venues</h2>
            <h3 class="info-title">From Abroad</h3>
            <p>All the venue sites located in the Walloon Brabant region around 20 min south from Brussels, Belgium’s capital city. We recommend staying in Brussels as it has many more options in terms of lodgings (hotels, hostels, airBnB…) as well as activities for those who wish to do some sight-seeing either before or after the wedding. There are train and bus stations in proximity of both the ceremony and reception venues, from where car-sharing can be arranged.</p>
